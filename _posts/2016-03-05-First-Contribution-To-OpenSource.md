Today was a very special day for me. I made by first contribution to Open Source Developemnt. I was looking at easy-fix issues listed in octokit.net, when I came across a bug in a power shell script. On reading the issue carefully and understanding it, I realised it was very easy. I jumped right in, but the problem was I didn't know anything about power shell scripts. I still decided to give it a try. I calmly looked at the script and after a moments it started making sense to me. I read through the code a figured where to write my piece of code. The issue was that it asked to remove an optional property after it asked the user if he wanted to change it. So, I added a if else condition and now it asked to press C to chnage the value and press R to remove it. I then ensured that everything was working correctly. I must have checked atleast 10 times. I didn't want to screw up the code. After this I went online and searched how to open a pull request, and opened one. Now, I waited for a reply from someone. And it came after sometime. The review was good and I was asked to make a few minor changes. I made those changes as soon as possible and committed the changes. I was very happy and felt motivated to work on the next issue. I went to the list of issue and began finding my looking for the 2nd contribution i could make!
